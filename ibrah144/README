Part 1: Followed the specifications on the handout to make it work.
Used the provided helper functions to get everything working, the
tricky part was converting the secret hex string into a uint8_t
string. I provided a link to a resource I used in order do the
conversion.

Part 2: Followed the specifications in the handout and the RFC
docs to get the lab working. The tricky part was actually
calculating the HMAC, but after reviewing the lecture and
re-reading the lab handout about using the sha1 functions I
was able to get an understanding of how it should work. I haven't
tested the program thoroughly.
