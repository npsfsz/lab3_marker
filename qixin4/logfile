For part 1, "generateQRCode.c" is used to generate the QR code. First we get the encodedurl for account name and issuer. After that we have to ensure that the hex secret we have received is 20 characters (from the handout its "12345678901234567890").To do so, we set a secretCount variable to count the length of the hex secret. if the length is less than 20, we have a function "paddingfunctionLess" which creates a 20 character secret, take in the existing one which is less than 20, and pad the rest with '0' to make sure its 20 characters. If the length is more than 20, we have a function "paddingfunctionMore" which cut the hex secret to 20 characters. After making sure hex_secret is 20 characters,  we convert the hex_secret into byte array and encode it with base32 encoding. After we have all the required information, we than build the strings required for the 2 QR codes. And lastly generate the 2 QR codes.
