generateQRcode.c
----------------
This program generates URIs and cooresponding QR codes for HOTP and TOTP keys
given issuer, account name, and a hex secret. The secret is padded with zeroes
as needed.

validateQRcode.c
----------------
This program generates HOTP and TOTP keys from a secret, and verfies the
user-provided values. It does this by computing the HMAC using either a counter
value (starting with 1), for HOTP, or the unix-time-mod-30 (creating a password
that expires every 30 seconds) for TOTP.
