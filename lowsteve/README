generateQRcode.c:

The first thing I did was write a function to decode the hex secret into its
byte value. Next I encoded this using the given base32_encode function.
Generating the URI's then became a simple string format.

validateQRcode.c:

Again the first thing I did was decode the hex string into its byte value.
Next I implemented the hmac_sha1 function as per RFC 2104 with the given sha1
implementation. After this I wrote the function to truncate the hmac into the
6 digit OTP code. Lastly, I put all these functions together into validation
functions for HOTP and TOTP.

The code for this lab has only been written to handle only secret_hex strings
of length 20 as per the lab handout.
