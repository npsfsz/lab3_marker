In the first part of the lab, the goal was to generate QR code for the given one time password. 
	The issuer and account name are processed by passing them through the urlEncode() function.
	The secrete key is decoded from ASCII HEX into a byte array. It is then passed to base32_encode() to convert into a base 32 string.
	The url is constructed using the processed data from the previous steps.
	The QR code is generated using the url

In the second part of the lab, the goal was to validate HOTP and TOTP values.
	HOTP uses a synchronized counter, which has a value of 1 in this case. The counter is processed into a 8 byte big endian value.
	TOTP uses the current system time divided by the period as the counter. The counter is also processed into a 8 byte big endian value.
	HMAC is calculated using the secret key and the counter. The secret key needs to be ASCII decoded and arranged in big endian format.
	The calculated result is compared with the input to validate passwords.
