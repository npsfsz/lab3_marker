In the first part of the lab, the goal was to generate QR code for the given one time password. 

	The issuer and account name are processed by passing them through the urlEncode() function.

	The secrete key is decoded from ASCII HEX into a byte array. It is then passed to base32_encode() to convert into a base 32 string.
