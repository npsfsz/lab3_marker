The purpose of this lab is to use both two-factor authentication and HMACS, to create programs that generate and validate one-time passwords that are compatible with Google Authenticator. 


"generateQRcode.c" 
This program is used to generate an otpauth:// URI.
We start by encoding the secret key in a special URI in two formats : HOTP key (HMAC-based One-Time Password) and TOTP key (Time-based One-Time Password). We need to encode proprely ACCOUNTNAME and ISSUER  by using the function provided urlEncode(). Then we need to convert SECRET from ASCII format to hex format then to base 32 using the function base32_encode(). 

"validateQRcode.c":
This program is used to verify the values the user has provided.
We are using the provided SHA1 function to create an HMAC= H[(K ⊕ opad) || H((K ⊕ ipad) || M)]. Using the SECRET (in hex) we create ipad and opad. The message M in the HMAC is the counter for HOTP and it is the current time for TOTP.
