Not sure if explanatios needed, but adding just in case

1. urlEncode acocuntName and issuer
2. 20 character input = 10 8 bit ints
	- For each 8 bit int, get the two characters and parse them into their hex value
		- Each character's value will occupy 4 bits inside each 8 bit int
		[char[0] | char[1]]   [char[2] | char[3]]   ...
3. Run base_32 encode to encode it into the secret of 16 base-32 values (80 bits / 5 bits)
	- This forms the encoded secret
4. concatenate all the encoded info into the TOTP and HOTP forms that were given

Both HOTP and TOTP share the HOTP function with the exception that TOTP's counter is UNIX_TIME/30.
The HOTP algorithm is done as so:
1. The TOTP counter can be up to 8 bytes, so we fill it inside innerMsg (left pad with 0)
2. We calculatae the secret in HEX, as it's given as a string array
	- We need it to be 64*8 bytes to XOR
	- We right pad the secret with 0 as specified in the documentation
3. XOR the secret with 0x36 for the inner pad, 0x5c for the outer pad
4. We calculate the SHA1 of the inner (iPAD + counterValue)
5. We calculate the SHA1 of the outer (oPAD + SHA1(iPAD + countervalue))
6. Use the truncate function found in the document to shrink it down to 6 bytes
7. MOD the value with 1000000 - this produces the HOTP/TOTP value
