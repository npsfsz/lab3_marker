Usage:
./generateQRcode <ISSUER> <USERNAME> <HEX_SECRET>

./validateQRcode <HEX_SECRET> <HOTP> <TOTP>

Explanations:
This lab implements a part of a 2 factor authentication system based on HOTP
and TOTP tokens

generateQRcode:
generateQRcode simply parses input parameters and generates URLs in specified
format. Provided QR code library is called to generate desired QR code.

The only challenge with this part was converting hex input provided as
a char array into it's binary representation.

validateQRcode:
this part needs to generate HOTP and TOTP codes and check if the generated code
matches provided input.
SHA1 hash function was used to generate HOTP tokens. HOTP algorithm was
implemented according to documentation provided in rfc4226.
HOTP takes a counter value as input, to generate a token. Since we are not
provided with the counter value within input, value of 1 was hardcoded.
This is the value used to generate QR code.

TOTP is identical to HOTP algorithm, except instead of a counter value, a timer
value is used. To acquire timer value we need to take current UNIX time in
seconds and divide it by period (30 sec by default). This value is being fed
into HOTP algorithm (instead of the counter value) to generate a TOTP code.

TOTP requires client's and server's clocks to be synchronized to within <30 sec
range in order to work. rfc6238 describes a mechanism that allows to account
for greater clock skew by calculating nearby values (simply by generating
codes with nearby timestamps), but it was not implemented in this lab,
because it was not a part of the lab specifications and the error tolerance
value was not provided.

Some challenges we faced with generating tokens were converting integers and
other numerical types into byte strings, because x86-64 is a little-endian
architecture and algorithms described in the documents were expecting
big-endian representation of numerical values as a byte string.
