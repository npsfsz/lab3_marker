Generating the QR codes was fairly simple in the given framework. I used a series of simple bit shifts to parse the hex secret into a binary value and used the built-in function to convert it to base 32. Then I created a string according to the format specified in the handout with the values supplied through the command line and used the built-in displayQRcode() function to print the QR code to the screen.
