The first part of this lab is to generate authentification url. The key part is to translate secret key input to hex value. Since the input of the key is in ascii, I wrote a parser to translate every two chars into hex value and combine them into a valid input to function base32_encode().



The second part of this lab is to verify HTOP value and TOTP value. Following the RFC docs, I calculate its HMAC with H((K | opad) || H((K | ipad) || m)), where H is sha1 and m is period time. TOTP follow the same formula but replace m with TIME value. After that, we need to truncate the hash value into 6 digits.
