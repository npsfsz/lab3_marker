part 1:

The main procedure is to urlencode the organization and account, then translate hex array into byte array and use encoding in base 32, then put everything in the url string.

part 2:

The hmac function(as well as dynamic truncation) is the same for both hotp and totp, so only needed to be implemented once. The validation procedure involves first translate hex string into byte array, then compute proper message(count=1 for hotp and current time for totp. notice the byte ordering). then we compute hmac for (secret,message) and dynamically truncate it. finally we mod by 1000000 to make sure that the result is 6 digits long and compare it with the input. if they match then the validation is successful.
