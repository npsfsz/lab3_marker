The first file simply converts the string representation of secret hex
to an array of bytes, then calls the provided base32_encode function
on that byte array. The two other user provided strings are passed to the
provided urlEncode function, and then all three quantities are printed to 
two strings representing the HOTP and TOTP URIs. Then the displayQRcode
function is called for each URI.

To validate the OTP codes taken from the QR codes, the string representation of secret hex
is again converted to an array of bytes, The counter or time value is generated
as a 64 bit number. The counter value is assumed to always be 1 and the period
for the TOTP is assumed to always be 30. An HMAC is generated using the 
secret hex number as a key and the message set to be the time for TOTP or the counter for HOTP,
using the HMAC method described in RFC 2104. The HMAC is then truncated to 6 digits as 
described in RFC 4226, and compared with the provided OTP input string.
