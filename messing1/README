For generateQRcode.c:
The main difficulty with this section was converting the ascii secret, to hex.
Otherwise this was simple matter of parsing, encoding, and concatenating the URL based on the specification in the lab handout.
To do the concatenation, we used snprinf() in combination with looping through arrays 1 byte at a time and adding the value to the string properly.


For validateQRcode.c:
We wrote a getHMAC() function and a DT() function derived from the specifications in RFC4226 & RFC6238.

The getHMAC function computed the inner SHA1 hash, as well as the outer SHA1 hash, based on the padded secret key, and either the count, or the time value.

The only major differences between validateHOTP & validateTOTP was the  generation of the static count (validateHOTP) & dynamic time value (validateTOTP). 
The time value for validateTOTP was generated using time.h functions.
